# PythonMiniProject
A mini project executed in python

This project was both very interesting and challenging,
I used to have a phobia of code... but now im just consiously weary of it.

The purpose of my program was to allow the user to enter a colour and a number

The number will allow the user to know if they are cool or not,
Although my code is 'kinda' fit for purpose

Here are some things to beware of 
- no colour input returns the right result
- type 7 to exit the first number loop
- in this code 'do you want to play again is a rhetorical question'(that never ends)

my learning outcomes
1)I truly did enjoy learning python and my 2 weeks with the trainers
2)I believe that as I continue my everyday life and play aound with python I will be able to fix my errors
3)Personally I do not like flowcharts
4)Syntax errors were designed to waste time
5)while loops and for loops have infinite power
